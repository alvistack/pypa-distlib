Description: Low-level components of distutils2/packaging, augmented with higher-level APIs
 Distlib contains the implementations of the packaging PEPs and other
 low-level features which relate to packaging, distribution and
 deployment of Python software. If Distlib can be made genuinely useful,
 then it is possible for third-party packaging tools to transition to
 using it. Their developers and users then benefit from standardised
 implementation of low-level functions, time saved by not having to
 reinvent wheels, and improved interoperability between tools.
